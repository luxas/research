# research

A place where I host some research content I've produced.

## File-specific Licensing

No general, repo-wide license for now. [Here's what that means](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/). Instead, each file or directory is **explicitly licensed** (e.g. using some kind of Creative Commons license).

## No Contributions (yet!)

In the future, I'd like to make this repo collaborative, such that I can accept contributions and check in the LaTeX source code. Sadly, I cannot at the moment, with this setup. But that will come at a later stage.
